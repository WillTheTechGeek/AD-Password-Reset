# AD-Password-Reset
A simple lightweight tool to reset password for admins and/or teachers to reset passwords.

This Program allows admins and teachers (if you are in an educational environment) to reset passwords very easily. All that has to be done is running the exe file and then type in the username and new password. If you select user must change password on next logon the password will be shown in a prompt otherwise it won't. In the environment I work in this is placed on a server network share and then using a GPO a shortcut to the program is placed on the teachers desktop.
You can either download the python files or the exe.
